# mouse-compare-latency

Python app using PyQT5 and RawInput to reliably compare mouse latency

# How this works

This application is inspired by microe's MouseComparator. However, instead of visually trying to compare counts in order to compare relative latency, this application calculates the proportional Euclidean distance reported by each mouse at a set interval giving a better idea of the difference in latency throughout the motion.

WIP: database with comparisons to RTINGs' results
